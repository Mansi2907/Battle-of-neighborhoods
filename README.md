**Battle of Neighborhoods**

The "Battle of Neighborhoods" project aims to assist a user in finding a new neighborhood in Toronto similar to their current one due to a job relocation. Data was collected by scraping neighborhood information from Wikipedia, obtaining latitude and longitude data via the Geocoder package, and sourcing venue information using the Foursquare API. After cleaning the data to remove empty records, duplicates, and unwanted symbols, we merged it into a single dataframe. Our analysis involved dividing Toronto into four boroughs and exploring specific neighborhoods to establish our framework, identifying the top 100 venues within a 500-meter radius for each neighborhood. We applied k-means clustering, revealing two primary clusters: Cluster 1, characterized by numerous parks, farmers markets, and Ethiopian restaurants, and Cluster 2, featuring more coffee shops, cafes, and pizza places, with both clusters having many fast food and falafel restaurants. Cluster 1 is more entertainment and sports-oriented, while Cluster 2 offers more hangout spots. Although the analysis provides valuable insights, it was conducted with a limited dataset, and additional data could improve the results. To run the project, install the necessary libraries, execute the provided Python scripts for data scraping and cleaning, apply k-means clustering, and visualize the data using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`. This README offers a comprehensive overview, including goals, methodology, results, and instructions for running and extending the analysis.
